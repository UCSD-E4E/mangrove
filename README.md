Team members:

Ashlesha Vaidya, Sidharth Suresh

Mangroves are trees and shrubs that have adapted to grow in the intertidal zone along subtropical coastlines.The main idea behind the project is to identify mangroves from the drone images. We use the semi-supervised clustering then classification approach to segment and classify images.

USAGE :
cd into the directory with code and data.
clustering.py. - python clustering.py --tilesDir <folder with Tiles> --outputDir <folder to save the clustered tiles>
