### What are mangroves?

Mangroves are a very valuable and understudied plant species.  They provide $100,000 per hectare per year in services that are critical to the overall health of coastal ecosystems.  Mangroves act as fishery habitats, they sequester carbon, filter runoff, and protect coastlines from hurricanes.
